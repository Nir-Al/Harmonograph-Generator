## What is a Harmonograph?
A harmonograph is a fascinating device that creates mesmerizing and complex patterns known as "Lissajous Curves." These patterns often resemble intricate, artistic, and symmetrical designs commonly found in nature and art. The device itself consists of swinging pendulums with a pen attached to draw on a surface below.

With this app, anyone can draw, explore and produce amazing artwork with their own digital Harmonograph simulator.

## How do I use the simulator?
To get started, you'll have four main factors to play with: amplitude, frequency, phase, and decay:
* Amplitude: controls the maximum swing of the pendulums, determining the width and height of the patterns.
* Frequency: alters the speed at which the pendulums swing, influencing the complexity of the designs. 
* Phase: refers to the initial starting positions of the pendulums, leading to variations in the symmetry of the patterns. Lastly,
* Decay Factor: influences how quickly the pendulums' motion diminishes over time, affecting the persistence of the patterns.

Experiment with different combinations of these factors to generate a mesmerizing array of harmonograph patterns. Have fun exploring the captivating world of harmonographs and unleash your artistic creativity!

**Tip:** You can use the "Randomize" Button to alter the parameters randomly, and explore unknown patterns.
